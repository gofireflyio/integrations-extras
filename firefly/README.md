# Firefly

## Overview
Firefly is a Cloud Asset Management solution that helps Cloud teams to discover all their cloud footprint (incl. AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and Datadog), automatically transform resources to Infrastructure-as-Code, detect drifts, and policy violations to make sure their cloud is aligned with its desired state.
Firefly helps teams make their Datadog assets immutable, versioned, scalable and monitored by managing them as code in any Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool of their choice.

### Full Cloud Inventory
Get a fully searchable inventory of all Datadog assets, alongside other cloud assets, such as AWS, K8s, GCP, Okta, and more.

### Automatic Codification
Automatically turn a single or multiple Datadog assets into code, including  Terraform, Pulumi, Cloudformation, and CDK.

### Detect and Fix Drifts
Get real-time notifications on any discrepancy and fix it as it occurs, directly to your repository.

### Detect and Fix Policy Violations
Get alerts and fix any policy violation, using pre-made or custom policies, using Firefly unified policy engine, to find hazardous misconfigurations or costly underutilizations.
